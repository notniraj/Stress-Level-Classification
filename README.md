# Stress-Level-Classification
  The student academic stress classification project involves us in building a model  which can predict the stress levels of a student based on a previous dataset of  anonymous responses to a questionnaire taken for training the dataset. This model uses multiple AI algorithms and incorporates it to analyse the data from the dataset and use it to predict new observations and classify them their own stress levels.
