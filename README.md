# Stress-Level-Classification
  The student academic stress classification project involves us in building a model  which can predict the stress levels of a student based on a previous dataset of  anonymous responses to a questionnaire taken for training the dataset. This model uses multiple AI algorithms and incorporates it to analyse the data from the dataset and use it to predict new observations and classify them their own stress levels. 


### Tools and Libraries Used 
1. NumPy and Pandas: 
• Usage: For data manipulation, handling, and exploration. 
• Description: NumPy provides numerical operations, and Pandas is used 
for structuring and analyzing dataframes. 
2. Scikit-learn (sklearn): 
• Usage: For machine learning tasks, including model building, 
preprocessing, and evaluation. 
• Description: A machine learning library offering tools for classification, 
regression, clustering, and other algorithms. 
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn: 
• Usage: For data visualization and plotting. 
• Description: Matplotlib is a plotting library, and Seaborn provides an 
interface for statistical graphics. 
4. MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder from Scikit-learn: 
• Usage: For feature scaling and encoding categorical variables. 
• Description: MinMaxScaler scales numerical features, and LabelEncoder 
converts categorical labels into numeric form. 
5. DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB, and SVC from Scikit-learn: 
• Usage: For building decision tree, Naive Bayes, and support vector 
machine models. 
• Description: DecisionTreeClassifier creates a decision tree based on 
features provided after data preprocessing, GaussianNB implements the 
Naive Bayes algorithm, and SVC constructs a support vector machine.

6. GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn: 
• Usage: For hyperparameter tuning using grid search. 
• Description: GridSearchCV searches through a predefined 
hyperparameter grid, helping identify the optimal model parameters.
